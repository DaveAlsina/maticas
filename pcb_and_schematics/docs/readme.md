# About the develped PCBs


In the folder **'./pcb\_and\_schematics/'** we have all the developed PCBs the first one is intended to recieve measurements from:

* Electroconductivity sensor.
* Water temperature sensor (DS18B20).
* pH sensor.

It also supports controlling actuators such as:

* 4 little water pumps of 5V and 150 mA each.
* 1 led strip of 12V 2A.
* 1 water pump of 12 V 2A.

All of that using an ESP32.
